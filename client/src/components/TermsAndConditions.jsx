          As service providers, we are responsible for our own content on these
          pages according to § 7 Abs.1 TMG. However, according to §§ 8 to 10
          TMG, we are not obligated to monitor transmitted or stored external

          Obligations to remove or block the use of information under general
          laws remain unaffected. However, liability in this regard is only
          possible from the time of knowledge of a specific infringement. Upon

        <p>
          Our offer contains links to external websites of third parties, over
          whose content we have no influence. Therefore, we cannot assume any
          liability for these external contents. The respective provider or
          operator of the pages is always responsible for the content of the
          linked pages. The linked pages were checked for possible legal
          violations at the time of linking. Illegal contents were not
          recognizable at the time of linking.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, permanent control of the content of the linked pages is not
          reasonable without concrete evidence of an infringement. Upon
          notification of violations, we will remove such links immediately.
